# Flight Delay Prediction
The basic problem of this exercise is to create a model capable of predicting the arrival delay time of a commercial flight, given a set of parameters known at time of take-off

To feed the application we will use data published by the US Department of Transportation: http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html

## Data analysis


## Data processing


## Create the model


## Model validation


## App execution
